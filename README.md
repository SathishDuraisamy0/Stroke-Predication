# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke Prediction Model
Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on clinical features. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle.

Model:
i used XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) for this classification task, which performed well with an initial accuracy of 91%. However, the F1 score was suboptimal, particularly due to a high false positive rate.

Improvement:
To address the false positives, hyperparameter tuning was applied using Grid Search and Random Search to find the optimal model settings. This tuning helped reduce false positives while balancing the precision and recall.

Results:
After tuning, the modelâ€™s accuracy decreased to 89%, but the F1 score improved significantly, with a notable reduction in false positives. This made the model more reliable for practical use, where minimizing false positives is crucial in healthcare settings.

Conclusion:
While there was a slight drop in overall accuracy, the model is now better balanced, with improved F1 score and reduced false positives, making it more suitable for stroke prediction in real-world applications.
